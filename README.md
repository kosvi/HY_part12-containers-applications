This repo contains most of the solutions for tasks in [this course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part12).


The last exercises required containerizing my own project and I did it [here](https://github.com/kosvi/HY_own_pipeline). Directory structure is not 100 % what was described, but I rather fitted
this in an already existing repository instead of creating yet another repo for the same project. I don't know if we were supposed to fix this to use our own mongoDB instead of the cloud-hosted.
